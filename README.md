Used Mysql to answer problems on a Kaggle data set titled Walmart
<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>In this SQL script, I conducted a thorough analysis of sales data from a Walmart store, utilizing a dataset sourced from <strong>Kaggle</strong>.</p>

<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>I began by enhancing the dataset through feature engineering, creating new columns to categorize sales by time of day, day of the week, and month.</p>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>Next, I delved into exploratory data analysis (EDA), addressing various questions posed in the dataset. I investigated unique cities and branches, popular product lines, common payment methods, and sales patterns across different time periods and locations.</p>

<h3>Sales Performance Metrics</h3>
<p>My analysis extended to sales performance metrics, including revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and value-added tax (VAT). Additionally, I explored customer-related insights, examining customer types, behaviors, and preferences.</p>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>Overall, my project aims to answer the questions outlined in the dataset, providing actionable insights to optimize sales, improve customer experiences, and enhance overall business performance within the Walmart store context.</p>
